        <p>Reorientation Week is a first-person puzzle platformer which revolves around the core mechanic of changing the direction of gravity. The player is able to point their crosshair in any direction and, upon clicking, redirect gravity so that "down" is now the direction in which they clicked. In order to progress through the game, the player must solve puzzles and complete platforming segments which utilize this gravity-change mechanic.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>The soundtrack for Reorientation Week is an experiment is "reactive music" - music which dynamically responds to the players actions in game. Like most of the sound effects, all instrumentation in the music was recorded from my Korg Prologue analog synthesizer. I was very much inspired by synthwave, complimenting the high tech futuristic aesthetic of the game. I also wanted the music to create a sense of mystery, as I think the game has a very mysterious and otherwordly atmosphere.</p>
    <p>At the start of a level, the music is just a simple repeating synth bass note, along with some occasional spooky synth ambience. Each time the player sequentially changes the direction of gravity however, additional instruments are layered on, ramping up the intensity of the music and creating the feeling of entering an altered state of reality. Initially the player can only change the direction of gravity once before resetting it back to normal. However they can collect upgrades which allow them to reorient gravity more times before resetting, thus meaning that they also gain access to more of the full piece of music. Since gravity can only remain altered for a short period of time however, and since the full track is around 4 minutes long, the player can still only hear fragments of the full piece of music even after collecting all 3 upgrades.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>On the first reorientation, an arpeggiated synth is introduced, harmonising over top of the static bass line. Various different harmonies are explored throughout the track. To create a sense of disorientation, I have these arpeggios panning from left to right. </li>
    <li>On the second reorientation, some fast-paced drums are introduced, heightening the intensity of the music. </li>
    <li>On the third reorientation, a massive synth pad comes in, doubling up the harmonies created by the arpeggios. Also, the synth bass line starts following the harmony instead of staying on one note. <strong>There are some melodic motifs played by the pad which are hinted at in the "natural gravity" track.</strong> </li>
    <li>On the fourth and final possible reorientation, some high end percussion comes in, just adding a little bit more intensity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since the dynamics of the music are controlled by the player's actions, each version of the music has to be pretty dynamically flat. If there was a part in the full version of the track where the dynamics die down, then the music might not ramp up as much in intensity depending on where in the track the player reorients gravity.</p>

    <h2>Gravity Gun</h2>
    <p>The gravity gun is the tool which the player uses to change the direction of gravity. All sound effects for the gun were recorded from my Korg Prologue analog synthesizer. To create consistency between these sound I made sure to use the same timbre for all beeps and boops. </p>
