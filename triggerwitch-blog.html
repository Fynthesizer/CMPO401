    <h2>Trailer</h2>
    <p>Today the trailer for Trigger Witch was publically released on Rainbite's Twitter and showcased on Kinda Funny Games, a YouTube channel with nearly 250,000 subscribers, in their E3 Showcase video among around 60 other indie games.</p>

    <p>From here I imagine that I'll be mainly working on Trigger Witch for the next year or so. My role in development sounds like it will generally be limited to composition with little to no involvement in sound design or audio programming. I'm really excited to be working on a fully realised commercial project. The game looks really sick and I'm amped to see how it turns out. </p>

    <h2>Trailer Track</h2>
    <p>While Trigger Witch is currently a secret, a trailer is currently in production which will be released for E3 (though not at the actual event). For the trailer, Tom requested 15-20 seconds of heavy music. Ideally this will be the same theme for the first dungeon in the game.</p>
    <p>It took me quite a few attempts to come up with something that I felt worked for the trailer (and that could also be used as dungeon music), but this is ultimately what I came up with. I ended up giving them a lot more than 20 seconds to work with.</p>

    <p>Although not required for the trailer I also started working on some ideas for what the light version of this track might sound like. To make the melody line sound more spooky and slow (without altering the tempo) I've removed a lot of the short passing notes.</p>

    <h2>Demo Track</h2>
    <p>Per Tom's request I have put together a light and heavy demo track. Both tracks feature the same melody and tempo so that they can be crossfaded between, but are very different in terms of rhythm, instrumentation, and harmonisation.</p>
    <p>The game's visual style to me is very reminiscent of Super Nintendo games such as A Link to the Past. Therefore I wanted the light track to  sound reminiscent of a classic SNES soundtrack. The Super Nintendo's sound chip used sample-based instruments, unlike earlier consoles such as the NES which mostly produced sound through simple synthesis. With just 64KB of RAM for audio however, the samples used for SNES instruments were generally very short and low quality.</p>
    <p>Originally I looked into simply using instruments ripped straight from SNES games, which are free for download online. After doing some research however, it looks like using these for a commercial project could be legally problematic. Therefore I instead attempted to create my own SNES-esque instruments by taking high quality instrument samples, bitcrushing them, loading them into an Ableton sampler, and chopping off most of the clip so just the attack and main body of the sample remain.</p>
    <p>For the heavy track I'm not trying so much to keep it authentic. The way I see it, the player pulling out their gun is the part of the game where it comically deviates from being a classic Zelda style experience, and so breaking free of SNES musical restrictions reinforces this transformation.</p>

    <h2>An Actual Job Opportunity</h2>
    <p>In the process of putting together this portfolio I might have actually stumbled into an actual game composition job. Shortly after finishing work on <a href="angrypeaches-blog.html">Angry Peaches</a>, I was reached out to by a friend of Zala's who is part of an indie game development studio. He was impressed by the music and saw the chiptune metal style of it as a great fit for their upcoming game, Trigger Witch.</p>
    <p>The game is a pixel art top-down twin-stick shooter, but with the structure of a Zelda game, featuring an open overworld with dungeons and bosses. Being a huge Zelda fan myself this seems like the perfect game for me to work on. For the music, they are wanting "cute fairytale" vibes for when the player is just walking around exploring the world. Once the player encounters enemies and starts shooting however, the music will shift into a heavy rock style version of the same song. Practically, this will mean that each song will require a light and heavy version to crossfade between. This is a similar system of dynamic music to what I've been doing for <a href="reorientation-week-blog.html">Reorientation Week</a>, although sonically the music will be more similar to Angry Peaches.</p>
    <p>Tom sent me some reference tracks for both the heavy and light themes and has asked that I put together a demo track with both light and heavy versions.</p>
