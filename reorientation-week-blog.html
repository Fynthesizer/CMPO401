        <p>Reorientation Week is a first-person puzzle platformer which revolves around the core mechanic of changing the direction of gravity. The player is able to point their crosshair in any direction and, upon clicking, redirect gravity so that "down" is now the direction in which they clicked. In order to progress through the game, the player must solve puzzles and complete platforming segments which utilize this gravity-change mechanic.</p>

    <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
    <p>When I started working on this portfolio, I had anticipated Reorientation Week to take up the same amount of work as the two or three other games I was working on. In the end, this game ended up being a major focus of the project, as there was just so much I wanted to do with it.</p>
        <p>My initial idea for this game's soundtrack was to create all the audio assets using just my Korg synthesizer. I eventually ended up deviating slightly and experimenting with different recording methods. While most of the sounds were recorded from the synthesizer, resulting in a unique science fiction atmosphere, I found that some of the more physical interactions in the game were better suited to traditionally recorded sound effects.</p>
    <p>Through working on this game I learnt a lot more than I expected to about sound design, reactive music, and audio programming. I'm really happy with how the final audio-visual aspect of the game turned out, although there are still things that I feel could be polished and improved on.</p>

    <h2>Demo Level</h2>
    <p>After creating sound effects for each of the objects and mechanics in the game, I found that the game didn't really have any levels which sufficiently put all of the sound design on display. Reluctantly I embarked on the task of creating a full demo level which incorporated all of the gameplay elements and sound design.</p>
    <p>I decided to start the player without the gravity gun, and only have the music start playing once they have picked up the gun later on in the level. This allows the ambience and sound design to have some time to shine. Once they have picked up the gun, they can only change the direction of gravity once before resetting. This means they can only hear the first two layers of music. Later on in the level however, the player will pick up upgrades, eventually allowing them to reorient up to 4 times, and thus to hear the full piece of music with all tracks. This means that the music becomes more intense as the player progresses through the level and becomes more competent with the game's mechanics.</p>

    <h2>Drones</h2>
    <p>The game includes one enemy, a flying drone that shoots laser beams at the player. To bring life to these characters I've created four different types of sound effects.</p>
    <p>The first sound is this noise loop that they constantly emit. I started by recording an electric shaver. In Ableton I then applied an LFO controlled low pass filter, which helps give the impression of spinning propellor blades.</p>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="assets/reoweekDroneHover.wav" type="audio/wav">
    </audio>
    <p>I wanted the drones to have their own personality, similar to the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NBDulvHYr8">turrets from Portal</a>. To achieve this I made them "chat" to each other when they are just flying around, before detecting the player. At random intervals they will emit one of these seven sound effects. These were recorded from the synthesizer, with me playing around with the pitch wheel to give the impression of speech.</p>

        <source src="assets/reoweekDroneDetect.wav" type="audio/wav">

    <p>The drones then start shooting lasers beams at the player, accompanied by this sound effect, basically just a sine wave quickly descending in pitch. </p>

    <h2>Moving Platform</h2>
    <p>The buttons and receptacles can also activate these floating platforms, which help the player to traverse large gaps safely. When the platform is moving it emits this sound. First I recorded a simple arpeggiated note from the synthesizer. When I put this into the game however it didn't seem to sound right. I then put a frequency shifter effect on the clip, which gave the sound a lot more of the mystical alien technology feel I was going for. </p>

    <h2>Ball</h2>
    <p>In the last post I mentioned the metal balls that the player must push into a receptacle. I wanted this ball to feel like a physical, tangible object. I looked around my flat for a large metal object that I could record rolling and banging into things and what I found was a rubbish bin. Even though shape-wise it is quite difficult to the virtual object it is representing, the sounds don't seem mismatched when playing the game. I've learnt through the course of this project that the human ear isn't that difficult to fool. When we see something happening on screen and hear a sound accompanying it, our mind associates the two things pretty easily.</p>
    <p>When the ball is being pushed around, this looping noise rises in volume depending on the speed of the ball.</p>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="assets/reoweekBallRoll.wav" type="audio/wav">
    </audio> 
    <p>When the ball hits a surface with enough velocity, one of these sounds will be played at random, with its volume being controlled by the force of the collision. I always like to take a few recordings for sounds like this, giving the impression that each collision is different, and that you're not just hearing the same audio sample each time.</p>

    <h2>Button and Receptacle Sounds</h2>
    <p>There are two possible ways to deactivate the laser walls described in the last post. Often there will be a button somewhere which disables the lasers. I went through many iterations of this sound. I wanted it to sound satisfying enough to let the player know they are making progress, while also being short and to the point. Melodically the sound is just moving from the root to the fifth. Perfect intervals are pretty common in "positive reinforcement sound effects". For example, these classic sounds from <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx6yf8pux4">Mario</a> and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HZ-kj3mP5Q">Zelda</a>.</p>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="assets/reoweekButton.wav" type="audio/wav">
    </audio> 
    <p>The second way to disable a laser wall is by pushing a metal ball into a receptacle. Once the ball falls into the receptacle it will disable the laser wall. If it falls out however, the laser wall will be reactivated. I went through many iterations of these sounds, but eventually I ended up going back to the sound that I had already made last year since I think they work really well. The deactivation sound is of course just the activation sound reversed, similar to the teleportation sound effect.</p>

    <h2>Laser Hum</h2>
    <p>Laser walls block the player's progress at various points in the game. If the player makes contact with them they will instantly die. I wanted to have the lasers emit a constant buzzing sound to reinforce the sense that they are active and dangerous to the player.</p>
    <p>This sound wasn't recorded from the synthesizer or with a microphone. I actually unplugged the end of the lead from my synthesizer and held it near a power board to record the electrical interference. I then applied some EQ and chorus to get this sound.</p>

    <h2>Teleporters</h2>
    <p>The player enters and exits levels via teleportation pads. The teleportation pads play a short animation when the player is teleporting in or out of a level, which I wanted to have accompanyed by a sound effect. After recording the entry teleporter sound effect, I simply reversed this to get the exit teleporter sound effect.</p>

    <h2>Footsteps</h2>
        <p>There are two main surfaces that the player walks on in the game. The first being a tiled floors and walls, the second being metal bridges. To assist the immersion and atmosphere of the game I wanted each of these surfaces to have its own set of footstep sound effects for when they are being walked on. Fortunately, I found that my apartment building has the perfect places to record both sets of footstep sounds. At the risk of mild embarassment, I recorded myself stomping about on both of these surfaces.</p> 
        <p>Unfortunately, both areas presented some problematic outside noise. In the tiled foyer area, a fan could be heard in the background. The steel grating was outside so the sounds of cars and wind presented a problem, as well as some strange electrical interference. I found that through some precise EQing and chopping I was able to salvage somewhat clean footstep sounds from the recording, although this has taught me a lot about the difficulties of recording sound effects in an uncontrolled environment.</p>

    <p>I've also used these recording to create a "landing" sound effect for when the player lands after a jump. To do this I simply programmed two of the clips to play in quick succession, simulating the sound of both feet hitting the floor.</p>

    <h2>Finished Dynamic Music Track</h2>
    <p>Finally I have created a finished piece of music for Reorientation Week. Initially, I wanted to have a few different tracks for different levels. However I later decided that instead of having two layers, one for normal gravity and one for altered gravity, I wanted the music to have several layers, with one being added each time that the player sequentially alters gravity. This leads to the music becoming more intense throughout the course of a long platforming section. After creating one four minute piece of music with dynamic layering, I felt that it was going to be too much of an undertaking to do at least two more.</p>
    <p>The soundtrack for Reorientation Week is an experiment is "reactive music" - music which dynamically responds to the players actions in game. Like most of the sound effects, all instrumentation in the music was recorded from my Korg Prologue analog synthesizer. I was very much inspired by synthwave, complimenting the high tech futuristic aesthetic of the game. I also wanted the music to create a sense of mystery, as I think the game has a very mysterious and otherwordly atmosphere.</p>
    <p>At the start of a level, the music is just a simple repeating synth bass note, along with some occasional spooky synth ambience. Each time the player sequentially changes the direction of gravity however, additional instruments are layered on, ramping up the intensity of the music and creating the feeling of entering an altered state of reality. Initially the player can only change the direction of gravity once before resetting it back to normal. However they can collect upgrades which allow them to reorient gravity more times before resetting, thus meaning that they also gain access to more of the full piece of music. Since gravity can only remain altered for a short period of time however, and since the full track is around 4 minutes long, the player can still only hear fragments of the full piece of music even after collecting all 3 upgrades.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>On the first reorientation, an arpeggiated synth is introduced, harmonising over top of the static bass line. Various different harmonies are explored throughout the track. To create a sense of disorientation, I have these arpeggios panning from left to right. </li>
    <li>On the second reorientation, some fast-paced drums are introduced, heightening the intensity of the music. </li>
    <li>On the third reorientation, a massive synth pad comes in, doubling up the harmonies created by the arpeggios. Also, the synth bass line starts following the harmony instead of staying on one note. <strong>There are some melodic motifs played by the pad which are hinted at in the "natural gravity" track.</strong> </li>
    <li>On the fourth and final possible reorientation, some high end percussion comes in, just adding a little bit more intensity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since the dynamics of the music are controlled by the player's actions, each version of the music has to be pretty dynamically flat. If there was a part in the full version of the track where the dynamics die down, then the music might not ramp up as much in intensity depending on where in the track the player reorients gravity.</p>

    <h2>More Gravity Gun Sounds</h2>
    <p>The player can collect upgrades which increase the maximum number of times they are able to sequentially reorient gravity before a reset. The first time the player collects an upgrade they will hear this sound effect. The sound uses notes from the minor 7 chord, with the root note being in tune with the music.</p>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="assets/reoweekUpgrade%20(1).wav" type="audio/wav">
    </audio> 
    <p>I wanted to create a continuous sense of progression for each upgrade that the player acquires. To achieve this, the subsequent upgrade sounds are each moved up a third from the previous one.</p>

    <p>After the player has changed gravity, they are under a 10 second time limit before gravity reverts back to normal. I wanted to emphasise the sense of time running out, reminding the player that if they are in a precarious situation they need to get to safety quickly. This sound effect will play on each of the last three seconds before time runs out.</p>

    <h2>Migration to FMOD</h2>
    <p>I've started moving all the sound and music handling for this project to FMOD Studio. After beginning to learn how the program works I've found that it offers me a lot more freedom and control over in-game audio. Although a lot of what it offers is theoretically do-able with Unity's audio engine, FMOD makes it a lot easier and more inuitive to experiment with sound. I find that I'm spending a lot less time rigorously coding audio events now.</p>
    <p>One thing I experimented with in FMOD was programming the music to slow right down after the player dies. I really like this effect and I think it goes well with the synth theme of the game, kind of sounding like a record player dying.</p>

    <h2>Falling Noise</h2>
    <p>This noise was surprisingly difficult to get sound right. The volume of this noise loop is controlled by the player's velocity. Since the player can die from falling too far, the noise is necessary to let the player know whether they've fucked up.</p>
    <p>To try and simulate the sound of wind, I started with white noise recorded from the Prologue. I then EQ'd out some of the highs, boosted the lows, and added some resonance. To create stereo width I recorded some more noise and panned both noise tracks to opposite sides. The result was a pretty sterile wind sound:</p>

    <h2>Gravity Gun Sounds</h2>
    <p>A lot of sound effects for the game were made last year for the prototype. With this project I want to try and replace any sounds I've already made, to try and form more of a consistent sonic aesthetic. I've begun by working on the sound effects for the gravity gun, probably the most important sounds in the game. All audio for these sounds was recorded from the Prologue, with some DSP applied in Ableton.</p>
    <h3>Reorient</h3>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="assets/reoweekReorient.wav" type="audio/wav">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio> 
    <p>This is the sound which plays whenever the player successfully changes the direction of gravity. I wanted it to have a massive impact, to make the player feel empowered. The sound has three layers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Charge: This is the sound produced by the gun just before firing. Originally this part was excluded, however I felt that the moment of impact would be more effective with a short lead-in. This sound is simply an oscillator rising in pitch, creating the effect that the gun is charging up. </li>
      <li>The Drop: This is the body of the sound. It's essentially just a sine wave dropping in pitch, with some added effects.</li>
      <li>The Tail: This part fades in as the drop is fading out. I wanted to create the effect that the gravity change was rippling through the environment. The sound is a noise oscillator which has its cutoff frequency modulated by a square wave. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Reset</h3>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="assets/reoweekReset.wav" type="audio/wav">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio> 
    <p>This sound plays when the player resets gravity to its original state by clicking the right mouse button. It is similar to the charge part of the Reorient sound effect, but with the oscillator decreasing in pitch instead of increasing, representing a return to normality.</p>
    <h3>Fail</h3>

        <source src="assets/reoweekFail.wav" type="audio/wav">

    <p>This is the sound for when the player attempts to reorient gravity but cannot do so. This can be for various reasons, such as the player running out of charges. I experimented with various patterns for this sound, but found that the universally accepted "du duh" worked best. </p>

    <h2>Testing Adaptive Music System</h2>
    <p>I've implemented an audio system to the game which controls the levels of tracks based on whether or not gravity is currently altered. In order to test the system I composed a short loop which represents the general direction I'm thinking of going with the music. The loop is split into two tracks: a base layer which contains the instruments that will be heard during standard gameplay, and an additional layer which is overlaid while gravity has been reoriented.</p>
    <h3>Base Layer (Natural Gravity)</h3>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="assets/reoweekTestTrackBase.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

    <h3>Additional Layer (Reoriented Gravity)</h3>

        <source src="assets/reoweekTestTrackLayer.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio> 
    <p>This track is mostly just for testing purposes, although it represents a few of the qualities which I'm aiming for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The base layer should work well on its own, but should also work with the additional layer.</li>
        <li>The base layer should generally be sparse and ambient, without any strong pulse.</li>
        <li>The additional layer should introduce a more defined rhythm to the music.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>When playing the game with this test track implemented, I did feel that the heavy synth bass was a bit cheesy. Since the player will likely be switching between natural gravity and reoriented gravity quite frequently, the instrumentation changes run the risk of being distracting or even annoying while playing. Moving forward I will try experimenting with more subtle layering. </p>

    <h2>Initial Thoughts and Planning</h2>
    <p>I first began working on Reorientation Week (still a working title) in 2018 as a project for my computer game design class. It was selected as one of the ten or so games that would be assigned a team to continue working on it for the following project. In this team I mostly focussed on coding and general directing. From the start, I had also intended to create a soundtrack for the game, however time constraints unfortunately meant I was only able to do some sound effect work. Now that I am returning to this project, I plan on redoing most of the sound effects, as well as creating multiple tracks for the game. </p>
    <p>My first idea for the soundtrack in this game was do some experimentation with "adaptive music". Broadly speaking, this refers to music which dynamically changes in response to events occuring in-game. For Reorientation Week, I wanted to have the music be atmospheric and sparse during regular gameplay, but become more intense when the player has altered the direction of gravity. This could be accomplished, for example by introducing new instruments to the track, altering the harmonic content of the music, or increasing the tempo. The desired effect is that the sonic change reaffirms to the player the significance of the transformation. The music should also create tension as gravity can only remain altered for a short period of time. </p>
    <p>The atmosphere of the game is pretty mysterious and otherworldly. I took a lot of inspiration from the shrines in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. To capture the ethereal quality of the game I plan on making heavy use of synth sounds. My plan is to attempt to create most, if not all, the games music and sound effects using my Korg Prologue analog synthesizer. </p>
    <p>The unique gameplay of Reorientation Week allows me to experiement with new ways of incorporating music into games. I'm super pumped to see how it turns out. </p>
