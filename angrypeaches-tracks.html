    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>With the soundtrack for Angry Peaches I wanted to capture the 8-bit style of the game, as well as the "anger" of the peaches. The game is pretty light-hearted fun so I wanted to make the music completely over the top in contrast. I start the track setting up the expectation that this will be a traditional NES style chiptune song, limiting instrumentation to simple 8-bit triangle oscillators, playing cute melodys in a major key. After a couple repeats of the main melody the style completely changes, introducing distorted guitars and heavy metal drums, and reharmonising the melody into a minor key. The aim was to create a humorous contrast between the epic chiptune-metal the player is hearing and the doofy flying peaches they are seeing on screen. </p>

    <h2>Sound Effects</h2>
    <p>I made heavy use of bit-reduction and downsampling to keep the sound effects of Angry Peaches in line with the 8-bit retro aesthetic.</p>
